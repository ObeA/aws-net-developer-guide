Sending Events to |CWlong| Events
#################################

.. meta::
   :description: Use this .NET code example to send events to Amazon CloudWatch Events.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for .NET examples, CloudWatch events


This .NET code example shows you how to:

* Create and update a scheduled rule to trigger an event
* Add a |LAMlong| function target to respond to an event
* Send events that are matched to targets

The Scenario
============

|CWElong| delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS
resources to various targets. Using simple rules, you can match events and route them to one
or more target functions or streams. This .NET example shows you how to create and update a rule used
to trigger an event, define one or more targets to respond to an event, and send events that are matched
to targets for handling.

The code manages instances using these methods of the
:sdk-net-api:`AmazonCloudWatchEventsClient <CloudWatchEvents/TCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsClient>` class:

* :sdk-net-api:`PutRule <CloudWatchEvents/MCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsPutRulePutRuleRequest>`
* :sdk-net-api:`PutTargets <CloudWatchEvents/MCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsPutTargetsPutTargetsRequest>`
* :sdk-net-api:`PutEvents <CloudWatchEvents/MCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsPutEventsPutEventsRequest>`

For more information about |CWElong|, see :cwe-dg:`Adding Events with PutEvents <AddEventsPutEvents>` in
the |CWE-ug|.

Prerequisite Tasks
==================

To set up and run this example, you must first:

* :cw-ug:`Get set up to use Amazon CloudWatch <GettingSetup>`.
* :sdk-net-dg:`Set up and configure <net-dg-setup>` the |sdk-net|.
*  Create a Lambda function using the hello-world blueprint to serve as the target for events. To 
   learn how, see `Step 1: Create an AWS Lambda function <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tutorial-scheduled-events-create-function.html>`_ 
   in the |CWE-ug|.
   
Create an IAM Role to Run the Examples
======================================

The following examples require an IAM role whose policy grants permission to CloudWatch Events and 
that includes :code:`events.amazonaws.com` as a trusted entity. This example creates a role named 
CWEvents, setting it's trust relationship and role policy. 

.. code-block:: c#

        static void Main()
        {
            using (var client = new AmazonIdentityManagementServiceClient())
            {
                // Create a role and it's trust relationship policy
                var role = client.CreateRole(new CreateRoleRequest
                {
                    RoleName = "CWEvents",
                    AssumeRolePolicyDocument = 
                    @"{""Statement"":[{""Principal"":{""Service"":[""events.amazonaws.com""]}," + 
                    @"""Effect"":""Allow"",""Action"":[""sts:AssumeRole""]}]}"
                }).Role;
                // Create a role policy and add it to the role
                string policy = GenerateRolePolicyDocument();
                var request = new CreatePolicyRequest
                {
                    PolicyName = "DemoCWPermissions",
                    PolicyDocument = policy
                };
                try
                {
                    var createPolicyResponse = client.CreatePolicy(request);
                }
                catch (EntityAlreadyExistsException)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine
                    ("Policy 'DemoCWPermissions' already exits.");

                };
                try
                {
                    var response = client.AttachRolePolicy(request2);    //managedpolicy
                    Console.WriteLine("Policy DemoCWPermissions attached to Role TestUser");
                }

Create a Scheduled Rule
=======================

Create an :sdk-net-api:`AmazonCloudWatchEventsClient <CloudWatchEvents/TCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsClient>`
instance and a :sdk-net-api:`PutRuleRequest <CloudWatchEvents/TCloudWatchEventsPutRuleRequest>` object
containing the parameters needed to specify the new scheduled rule, which include the following:

* A name for the rule
* The ARN of the |IAM| role you created previously
* An expression to schedule triggering of the rule every five minutes

Call the :sdk-net-api:`PutRule <CloudWatchEvents/MCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsPutRulePutRuleRequest>` method
to create the rule. The :sdk-net-api:`PutRuleResponse <CloudWatchEvents/TCloudWatchEventsPutRuleResponse>`
returns the ARN of the new or updated rule.

.. code-block:: c#

            
            var putRuleRequest = new PutRuleRequest
            {
                Name = "DEMO_EVENT",
                RoleArn = "IAM_ROLE_ARN",
                ScheduleExpression = "rate(5 minutes)",
                State = RuleState.ENABLED
            };

            using (var client = new AmazonCloudWatchEventsClient())
            {
                var putRuleResponse = client.PutRule(putRuleRequest);
                Console.WriteLine("Successfully set the rule {0}", putRuleResponse.RuleArn);
            }

Add a |LAM| Function Target
============================

Create an :sdk-net-api:`AmazonCloudWatchEventsClient <CloudWatchEvents/TCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsClient>` instance
and a :sdk-net-api:`PutTargetsRequest <CloudWatchEvents/TCloudWatchEventsPutTargetsRequest>` object containing
the parameters needed to specify the rule to which you want to attach the target, including the ARN
of the |LAM| function you created. Call the :sdk-net-api:`PutTargets <CloudWatchEvents/MCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsPutTargetsPutTargetsRequest>`
method of the :code:`AmazonCloudWatchClient` instance.

.. code-block:: c#

            
            var putTargetRequest = new PutTargetsRequest
            {
                Rule = "DEMO_EVENT",
                Targets =
                {
                    new Target { Arn = "LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN", Id = "myCloudWatchEventsTarget"}
                }
            };
            using (var client = new AmazonCloudWatchEventsClient())
            {
                client.PutTargets(putTargetRequest);
            }


Send Events
===========

Create an :sdk-net-api:`AmazonCloudWatchEventsClient <CloudWatchEvents/TCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsClient>`
instance and a :sdk-net-api:`PutEventsRequest <CloudWatchEvents/TCloudWatchEventsPutEventsRequest>` object
containing the parameters needed to send events. For each event, include the source of the event,
the ARNs of any resources affected by the event, and details for the event. Call the
:sdk-net-api:`PutEvents <CloudWatchEvents/MCloudWatchEventsCloudWatchEventsPutEventsPutEventsRequest>`
method of the :code:`AmazonCloudWatchClient` instance.

.. code-block:: c#

            var putEventsRequest = new PutEventsRequest
            {
                Entries = new List<PutEventsRequestEntry>
                {
                    new PutEventsRequestEntry
                    {
                        Detail = @"{ ""key1"" : ""value1"", ""key2"" : ""value2"" }",
                        DetailType = "appRequestSubmitted",
                        Resources =
                        {
                            "RESOURCE_ARN"
                        },
                        Source = "com.compnay.myapp"
                    }
                }
            };
            using (var client = new AmazonCloudWatchEventsClient())
            {
                client.PutEvents(putEventsRequest);
            }
